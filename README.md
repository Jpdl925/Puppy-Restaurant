// Comments: 
-index.html the responsiveness is on point. Great work.
-about.html the responsiveness is also great here, potentially add a rol-col-md-1 breakpoint on the picture and the story behind the grill to make the picture on top of the story behind the grill on smaller screen.
-menu.html the page is amazing, responsiveness is done very well.
-catering.html the first image doesn't resize properly on smaller screen, could work on responsiveness on this, i believe a 100% width and height should resolve it.
-photo.html this page is overall very good looking but I did notice that the background doesnt repeat and you get a white background at the very bottom on smaller screen but thats a minor issue thats easily solveable.
